1.0
===

* Add support for additional fields configurable via the tool.
  The tool grew two new properties: a boolean 'allow_additional_fields'
  (default:False) and a list 'additional_fields' (default: ['howpublished',
  'recommended_by'] - just for example) to enable the portal manager to 
  define further custom (string-type) fields on bibitems [raphael]

* Factored out the author reference/link handling into adapters for
  easy overrides [martior]

* Refactored the tests to make better use of layers [rossp]

* Generalized the handling of identifiers via the new 'identifiers' field.
  This field manages a configurable list of arbitrarily many additional ids.
  The 'old way' via the individual fields for ISBN, PMID, and DOI is still
  supported but "hidden away" [raphael]

* Add our own keyword field to get out of the way of DC Subject [raphael]

* Add filterOutDupesByTitle() (used in bibliography_view for filtering
  out identical documents by title comparison) [ajung]

* Merging uyar's branch to make the content types ATCT-based plus several
  schema adjustments [raphael]

* Introducing marker interfaces for all content types and hooking them up.
  [raphael]

* Import IFileNameNormalizer from the new location and use a few viewlet
  managers instead of macros in the bibitem_view. [raphael]

* Renamed the Plone id cooker from 'plone.py' to 'ploneid.py'. This was
  causing all sorts of problems because 'plone' is a top-level namespace
  now and we don't want to mask that. [raphael]

* CMFBibliographyAT is still far from being useable as a utility, so remove
  the tool utility registration.

* Correct test failures for bibliography folders.

* Use the proper plone.i18n normalizer instead of plone_utils.normalizeString.

* Change 'marc' to 'marcgt' in the expected test output: this has been 
  changed in bibtex 3.1.

* Refactored all parsers into utilities located in the new bibliograph.parsing
  package.
