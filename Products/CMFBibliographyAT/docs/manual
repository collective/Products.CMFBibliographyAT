About CMFBibliography

  CMFBibliography is an extension of Plone to allow for the handling
  of references to (scientific) publications. It consists of a couple
  of content types like the Bibliography Folder to hold the various
  different reference types like Article References, Book References,
  etc. (for a complete list see below). CMFBibliography comes with a
  tool that enables import and export of bibliographic information in
  a number of standard formats. The support of these formats is
  realized by different parsers (for the import) and renderers (for
  the export).

  The development of CMFBibliography is hosted at SourceForge, so
  everybody who would like to contribute to its development is invited
  to do so.

  This manual consists of three main parts, namely

 1. "**The User's Guide**":users explains the features and usage of
    CMFBibliography from a users perspective. It covers the
    functionality of the Bibliography Folder and the various entry
    types.

 2. "**The Administrator's Guide**":admin addresses installing and
    customizing CMFBibliography.

 3. "**The Developer's Guide**":devel contains information necessary
    to understand CMFBibliography's approach in order to enable
    further development from third parties. In particular, it contains
    a documentation of the API and the various schemata used.
