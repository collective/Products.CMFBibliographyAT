Installing CMFBibliography

  CMFBibliography is a standard Zope/CMF/Plone product so you install
  it like any other product by moving or copying the source code into
  your site's products folder (usualy something like
  ../yourZope/Products or ../yourZope/lib/python/Products depending on
  your installation) and restarting the server.

  Next you have to tell your Plone instance that you want to use
  it. There are at least three ways to do so. Log in as manager and
  then either go to 'plone setup' -> 'add products', select
  'CMFBibliography' and click 'install'. Make sure, however, that you
  have ArcheTypes installed first, otherwise the installation will
  fail (newer versions of Plone come with ArcheTypes included, so you
  should not have to worry).  Alternativly you can go to the ZMI and
  then either use the Quickinstaller from there or you install it
  using an External Method refering to the products 'install' method
  from the 'Install' module in the 'Extensions' folder.

  After successfull installation you should have a number of new
  content types available, namely the Bibliography Folder and all the
  different reference types as well as the Bibliography tool including
  a few parsers and renderers.


Customizing CMFBibliography

  Possible customizations mainly concern the skin methods which
  control the appearance of the Bibliography Folder and its
  entries. Whereas their 'views' are just page templates like any
  other content type's view, there are some more specific methods that
  need some explanation.

 Customizing the formatting of the author list

  To control for the formatting of the author list, the reference
  type's 'Authors' method understands a number of optional arguments
  through which you can specify whether first names should be
  abbreviated or not, whether they should be leading or trailing last
  names, what to use as sparator between names, whether or not to
  include links to the authors' URLs etc.  (see the Developer's Guide
  for a more formal description). Use these arguments when customizing
  view templates with respect to the author list formatting.

  If those options are not sufficient for your needs, you can
  alternatively access the raw authors information via the reference
  type's 'getAuthors' method. This method returns a list of
  dictionaries, one for each author, holding the respective parts of
  the author information like first names (key: 'firstname'), middle
  part (key: 'middlename'), last names (key: 'lastname'), and the
  homepage (key: 'homepage').  You can then process this list of
  dictonaries to fit your needs.

Customizing the formatting of the source string

  The other specialized method is the 'Source' method that controls
  the formatting of the source string. (This is the part that looks
  somethig like: *Journal of Irreproducible Results, 345(6):77-88.*)
  This source string is formatted differently for the individual
  reference types and you find the corresponding methods like
  'ArticleSource' in the 'bibliography' skin folder from where you can
  customize them for the different reference types as needed.

 Controling the supported import/export formats

  To add or remove support for certain import or export formats go to
  the management interface of the 'Bibliography Tool' (via ZMI). Here
  you can add or remove parsers or renderers as you see fit. Currently
  there is only a very limited amount of parsers and renderes
  available some of which require additional software to be installed
  on your server. See the Developer's Guide on how to provide your own
  parser or renderer.

 Enableling the Large Bibliography Folder

  The Bibliography Folder comes in two flavors:

  - **Bibliography Folder:** This uses a regular folder (Archetype's
    'BaseFolder' as base class whereas the

  - **Large Bibliography Folder** uses 'BaseBTreeFolder as base class.

  Per default, only the regular folder type is enabled for the users
  to be added. Use the 'Implicitly addable' flag on the respective
  factory type information objects available through the types tool to
  customize which ones to offer at your site.
